# Drinking the FreeBSD Kool-aid

What even is FreeBSD?

I started looking into FreeBSD due to the fact that I have a very limited amount of experience with systems level programming and operating systems. 

I thought originally about writing my own Toy OS and using the bare minimum tools for the job, but all the resources end up finding are way too big brain for me. Even the OSDev wiki is too much for me after awhile.

I recently watched a video from MentalOutlaw called [OpenBSD Desktops are for Hackers only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmgJxMda-E4) where he talked about OpenBSD and it peaked my curiosity in what BSD is. I decided that FreeBSD looked cool because it has a handbook that is packed with technical information.

So, I'm going to try and write some posts here on my experience with FreeBSD from a user and programming aspect. Maybe I wont be a "linux cultist" (not) forever.
